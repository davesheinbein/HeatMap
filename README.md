# Visualize Data with a Heat Map
---

This project visualizes global temperature changes from 1754 to 2015 using a heat map, allowing users to explore historical temperature trends. Built with D3.js, this interactive data visualization provides insights into global temperature variations across the years.

## Live Demo

You can view and interact with the project on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/dsDeveloper/pen/xxvryGM)

## Features

- **Interactive Heat Map**: Displays global temperatures by year and month, using color to indicate temperature variations.
- **Dynamic Tooltips**: On hover, tooltips show details such as year, month, and temperature.
- **Legend**: A color legend for interpreting temperature ranges at a glance.
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows loading status while data is fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if data loading fails.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile.

## Technology Stack

- **D3.js**: For creating the SVG elements, handling scales, axes, and tooltips.
- **HTML/CSS**: Styles the layout, container, color themes, and tooltip design.
- **JavaScript**: Manages data fetching, chart rendering, tooltip interaction, and legend creation.

## Files

- **index.html**: Sets up the heat map container, tooltip, and includes D3.
- **styles.css**: Custom styling for colors, gradients, tooltips, layout, and responsive adjustments.
- **script.babel**: Main JavaScript file for data fetching, scaling, axis setup, heatmap cells, and legend functionality.

## Installation

To view or run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. Ensure an internet connection for D3 library access.

## Usage

- Hover over any cell in the heat map to see detailed temperature data for a specific month and year.
- Use the color legend to interpret temperature variations.
